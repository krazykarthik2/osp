# MODULES

This document lists the intended modules for a sample operating system. Use this as a roadmap for development and prioritization.

---

1. Boot System 🔌

- Bootloader
- CPU mode initialization
- Stack setup
- Kernel loading
- Jump to kernel entry
- Architecture Abstraction
  - x86 boot path (Bochs)
  - ARM64 boot path (Pi)
- Linker & Memory Layout
  - Kernel sections
  - Stack regions
  - Heap regions

---

2. Kernel Core ⚙️

- Kernel Entry
- Early initialization
- Zeroing BSS
- Panic & Debug

Build note: A small example kernel is available under `kernel/` and can be built with `build_kernel.bat` which compiles `kernel/kernel.c` and `kernel/kernel_entry.asm`, then links using `linker.ld` to produce `build/kernel.bin`.
